# Physics-Simulation-
For all the lovers of Computational Physics this is a repository to contribute 
.(This repository is aimed to model Physics problems) .
We use mathematical model to describe the physical model and use the power of computation to solve complex equatuions and model 
.All the data files generated can be plotted with a plotter such as gnu plot , matlab(has a plotter) etc and then analyse the graph . 
Hope all the enthusiast will regularly be updating the repositiory .
Feel free to update my code
